0.2.2
	Thanks to @JadeOfMaar for this:
		Raised their costs, masses, capacities and ElectricCharge demands to compare well with Nertea's Heat Control.
		Disabled parent cooling only so they're effective from anywhere on vessel.
		Updated titles and descriptions.

	Nuclear jet
	    Decreased Isp so it requires more air. It's extremely efficient just by handling IntakeAtm, but it can't be that efficient with IntakeAtm itself.
	    Decreased heat production so it doesn't threaten to overheat so soon.

	Waterfall
	    Waterfall configs for all engines. Contributed by Hohmannson (same name on GitHub and KSP forum). Derived from Stock Waterfall Effects by Knight of St John.

0.2.3
	Converted most textures to dds


0.2.4
	Thanks to @JadeOfMaar for all the following:

	FTmN:
		Added/Updated effect configs where necessary, with and without Waterfall.
		Added config for deprecating old redundant/duplicate parts when FTmN and FTmN_New are installed together.
		Added alternators to most engines.
		Raised thrust by 2.5x and mass by roughly 2x.
		Lowered heat production value so engines don't threaten to overheat so quickly.
		Updated titles to neatly group the engines and reflect updated thrust and suggested engine types.
		Updated specific impulse to reflect suggested engine types and be better vacuum optimized.
		Updated tech node positioning.
		Updated some engines into bimodal/LANTR.
		Updated BL40n model to resolve normal map issue.
		
	LV-N Clusters:
		Added/Updated effect configs where necessary, with and without Waterfall.
		Raised thrust by 2.5x.
		Lowered heat production value so engines don't threaten to overheat so quickly.
		Updated titles to make you chuckle and neatly group the engines.
		Updated specific impulse. Added very slight sea level performance.

0.2.4.1
	Added missing thrust update on one engine

0.2.4.2
	Thanks to @JadeOfMarr for this:
		title and tech node fixes
