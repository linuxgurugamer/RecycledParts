Hello!
This baby was modeled with a Lightwave modeler, mapping and set up done with Bryce 4.
Its rather detailed, and good looking, so enjoy it all folks out there !

The files in this zipped file are Lightwave format, for the Bryce format takes too much memory for upload...sorry...
however with the LW import option contained within Bryce 4 you can remap all the stuff easily as I have done.
Cheers to everyone...
